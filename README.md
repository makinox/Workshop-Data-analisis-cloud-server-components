### Preparation

To install dependencies just run

```
pnpm install
```

To use the app make sure you have the correct variables, follow this example for more information: https://fife-docs.vercel.app/google-intro/spreadsheet-api

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
